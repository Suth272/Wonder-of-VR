                    VR stands for Virtual Reality and is the use of computer technology to create simulated
                    environments. People can then interact with these environments through VR headsets in a first person
                    perspective. Users can move around and interact with objects within these virtual enivironments
                    using these
                    headsets and VR controllers, which usually accompany the headsets when purchasing a VR headset.
                    Users can completely immerse themselves in these virtual environments exploring vast worlds within
                    the comforts of there own home. VR allows for the surreal to become real with the aid of computer
                    software and 3D design, with the main program being used to produce VR environments being unity. In
                    terms of VR headsets, there are plenty to choose from to get immersed in these environments, with
                    the most popular headsets being the Valve Index and the Meta Quest 2.

                    Now that we have an understanding of what VR is, what is it good for? Well below we'll talk about
                    the four main areas in our society that will benefit the most from VR.

                        One use of VR is training. VR makes it possible to train personnel safely, efficiently and
                        cost-effectively. It can
                        be especially beneficial to those in high-risk or highly specialized positions, such as
                        firefighters, EMTs, police officers, soldiers, surgeons or other medical personnel.

                    <div class="uses-text">
                        Another use of VR is the education sector. VR offers educational institutions new methods for
                        teaching and learning. It can provide
                        students with intimate insights into environments that are typically inaccessible, while keeping
                        them engaged in the learning process. For example, a history teacher might use VR to show
                        students
                        firsthand what life was like in ancient Greece or China.

                    </div>
                    <div class="uses-text">
                        VR also has the potential to benefit individuals across the healthcare industry, including
                        patients, practitioners and researchers. For example, VR shows promise in treating disorders
                        such as
                        anorexia, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). On the other hand, doctors might be
                        able
                        to use VR when working with the patients to explain diagnoses or treatment options. VR could
                        also
                        benefit individuals who are physically limited in some way.

                    </div>
                    <div class="uses-text">
                        The final and most obvious use of VR is entertainment. VR has already had an impact on gaming,
                        but it also promises to transform the film
                        and television industries, providing viewers with an immersive experience that puts them right
                        into
                        the scene. VR could also lead to an entire industry in virtual tourism, making it possible for
                        people to experience places that they might never be able to see in-person.
